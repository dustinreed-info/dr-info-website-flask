            About Me:
        </h1>
        <p>
            My name is Dustin Reed and I am a certified AWS Solutions Architect and Developer. I have been in enterprise IT since 2010.
            I have had a lifelong passion in computing.  In fact, one of my first memories is typing my name on a Commodore 64.  When I 
            was about 8 years old I wrote my first application in QBasic to brute force a password that my Dad put on a game that I had liked at the time.
            In high school I started developing games on my TI-83 calculator and then took a computer programming class and learned
            Turbo Pascal and C++.  Eventually I started a job in IT Operations.  I then leveraged my programming knowledge to create shell scripts
            to automate my day to day tasks.  As my programming skills increased, I decided to learn PowerShell as it is integrated with most Windows Services.
            I am now focusing on Python and boto3 which is a SDK for managing AWS services.
            I am utilizing DevOps methodologies to define my cloud infrastructure as code and track any changes with version control and then automate deploy my
            code to the cloud platforms with my CI/CD Pipelines.  This allows me to architect infrastructure that is scalable, highly available, secure,
            repeatable, and consistent.  This eases the burden on releasing software deployments allowing applications to be decoupled
            into microservices and then distributed to specific resources.

            About my Website:
        </h1>
        <p>
            This website is being distributed via datacenters in the US, Canada, and Europe using a CloudFront distribution. When I need to update my website,
            I can create a test branch in my AWSCodeCommit repository from my master branch. I then pull my test branch to my local git repo and edit the
            code via my IDE. Once my code has been verified working locally, I commit it, while creating a comment documenting what the commit is doing,
            and then push it back into the test branch of my remote repo. I then can review the changes and merge the branches and then I can remove the
            test branch. I leverage CloudWatch to watch for changes in the test branch and then if there is a change it will call CodePipeline to
            automatically deploy those changes to the S3 bucket where my test website is hosted. Once I have verified, I can access the website generated
            by my test branches pipeline I can merge those changes into my Master branch which is then deployed via my Master branches pipeline.
            Which then deploys my master branch's s3 bucket. I then create a CloudFront distribution and point it to my s3 bucket and create a bucket
            policy specifying which files I want distributed globally. I then create an A record pointing to my CloudFront alias id in AWS Route 53.
