                <p>
                    My passion for computing began at a young age, starting with my first application
                    in QBasic at age 8 and evolving into creating text-based games on my TI-83 calculator
                    in high school. This early curiosity laid the foundation for my career in technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently serving as a Cloud Engineer, I specialize in designing
                    cutting-edge Azure solutions and implementing automated CI/CD pipelines for government
                    cloud environments. My expertise spans Agentic AI platforms, Databricks integrations,
                    and modern DevOps practices that enable rapid, reliable software deployment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By implementing CI/CD pipelines, I can deploy applications to cloud platforms in a
                    fault-tolerant, scalable, and distributed manner. This approach reduces risk and
                    complexity for software deployments, enabling businesses to quickly adapt to changing
                    market conditions and be more agile.
