    About Me:
</h1>
<p>
    As a Sr. DevOps Engineer with over a decade of experience in enterprise IT, 
    I have a passion for computing that began at a young age. From creating my first 
    application in QBasic at age 8 to developing text-based games on my TI-83 calculator 
    in high school, I have always been drawn to programming. My background in IT Operations 
    has allowed me to leverage my programming knowledge to automate daily tasks, starting 
    with batch scripts and eventually mastering PowerShell and Python.
    <br><br>
    Today, I am focused on utilizing DevOps toolchains and methodologies to design infrastructure 
    as code and track changes with version control. By implementing CI/CD pipelines, 
    I can deploy applications to cloud platforms in a fault-tolerant, scalable, and 
    distributed manner. This approach reduces risk and complexity for software deployments, 
    enabling businesses to quickly adapt to changing market conditions and be more agile. 
    Be sure to check out my Projects section for examples of my work.
